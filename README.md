I am a Data Scientists/Machine learning Engineer, before getting started in Data Science I was a Linguist with experience in Language Education. In October 2022 I completed a certificate course with Practicum, and I am very passionate about making and tuning machine learning models. After completing my time at practicum, the gave me an oportunity to participate in an externship, from which I gained Employment at Cuetessa building machine learning models.  
<br></br>
I have developed skills in various areas of Data Science, including: 
- Data analysis and Visualisation using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborne
- Machine learning using SKlearn, tensorflow, catboost, and others
- Natural Langauge Processing
- Image recognition and object detection


In my time in Cuetessa I have developed skills in: 
- Audio analysis and feature extraction
- Machine Learning using CNNs
- Paramater tuning for large scale models
- Optimizing models to tap into the potential of the hardware available 
<br></br>
- I am looking to advance my career in Data Science
- I am working on a personal project that combines Second Language Acquisition with Machine learning in a Unique way
