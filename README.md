I am a Data Scientists/Machine learning Engineer, before getting started in Data Science I was a Linguist with experience in Language Education. In October 2022 I completed a certificate course with Practicum, and I am very passionate about making and tuning machine learning models. I have developed skills in various areas of Data Science, including: 
- Data analysis and Visualisation using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborne
- Machine learning using SKlearn, tensorflow, catboost, and others
- Natural Langauge Processing
- Image recognition and object detection
